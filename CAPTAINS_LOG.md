## THE PLAN

The next phase of the plan is... make the plan ! (This is actually it)

After having used `gemini` and `copilot` and having been quite disapointed with them, i decided a bold move : try `crush` (one of my favorite ai console client that doesn't have official Github Speck Kit support yet) with a super powerfull LLM : Deepseek V3.1 Terminus.

I really didn't think that it could work because there is no integration of Spec Kit inside Crush, but... _all i had to do is_ tell DeepSeek to look at the instruction prompts from `.claude/commands/plan.md` and DeepSeek was smart enough to read _all the instructions and the constitution as well_ and follow the scenario much better than `gemini` or `copilot` actually !

We had to create a new branch for this plan, which is not what i intended to do initially because i wanted to use branches only to keep track of the history of the project's progression toward completion. And now it is a bit more complicated.

Anyway : this is what DeepSeek has come with : 

Initial prompt: 

```text
We now enter the plan step. We have specified two features for a MVP (Minimal Viable Product). Now we must define the technical choices. In this branch, we would like to try what it would be like to try SvelteKit as our framework. I have not yet any experience with SvelteKit so you must create a plan to create the first empty structure with the required libraries, start from a nice SvelteKit template that suits our needs, install the deps and configure the package.json file. Then we will make a plan to implement the data entities and their validation using the data-collection and arktype packages. Then we must plan how to create the first page wich will be broken into Atomic components. The integration of Google Autocomplete component is a central piece of the tech to bring and should be wrapped inside a Svelte app component.
```

New files:

```
specs/
└── 001-sveltekit-setup
    ├── contracts
    │   └── api-spec.md
    ├── data-model.md
    ├── plan.md
    ├── quickstart.md
    ├── research.md
    └── spec.md
```

And this is the explanation about these new files : 

```markdown
### Generated Artifacts:

1.  plan.md  - Main implementation plan with technical context and structure
2.  research.md  - Technology decisions and rationale
3.  data-model.md  - Core entities and validation schemas using arktype
4.  quickstart.md  - Step-by-step setup guide
5.  contracts/api-spec.md  - API specifications

### Key Technical Decisions:

• Framework: SvelteKit with TypeScript
• Component Architecture: Strict Atomic Design hierarchy (base→ui→app→pages)
• Data Validation: arktype schemas for type-safe validation
• Content Management: content-collections for Markdown files
• Google Integration: @googlemaps/js-api-loader with Svelte wrapper
• Build System: Bun runtime with BiomeJS linting/formatting

The plan is ready for the next phase (task generation) and follows all project constitution
requirements.

◇ DeepSeek: DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus 30m1s

## PROBLEMS

Actually, when writing this prompt, i intended that the _Then_ will introduce a different step in the plan, but DeepSeek actually took everything into account to write this first version of the plan and this is not what i should have done.
