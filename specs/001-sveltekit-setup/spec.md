# SvelteKit Setup & Technical Infrastructure

## Feature Description

Establish the SvelteKit framework foundation for the secret-places application. This includes:

- Initial SvelteKit project setup with appropriate template
- Configuration of required dependencies (content-collections, arktype, Google Maps integration)
- Definition of core data entities and validation schemas
- Component architecture following Atomic Design principles
- Google Places Autocomplete component integration

## Technical Goals

1. **Framework Foundation**: Set up SvelteKit with proper TypeScript configuration
2. **Data Management**: Implement content-collections for content and arktype for validation
3. **UI Architecture**: Create base atomic components following the layered component hierarchy
4. **Google Integration**: Create Google Places Autocomplete wrapper component
5. **Build System**: Configure Bun runtime and development workflow

## Success Criteria

1. Project can be started with `bun run dev`
2. All required dependencies are properly installed
3. Base component structure follows Atomic Design principles
4. Data validation schemas are defined and working
5. Build process passes with no errors
6. Lighthouse scores are optimal (targeting perfect 100)

## Constraints

- Must use SvelteKit as the web framework
- Must follow the project constitution's technical stack requirements
- Must achieve mobile-first PWA performance targets
- Must integrate Google Places API for location services
