# Research: SvelteKit Setup & Technical Infrastructure

## SvelteKit Template Selection

**Decision**: Use SvelteKit skeleton template with TypeScript

**Rationale**: 
- Skeleton template provides minimal setup without unnecessary dependencies
- TypeScript support is essential for type safety
- Easy to customize for our specific needs
- Maintains KISS principle by avoiding complex boilerplate

**Alternatives considered**:
- SvelteKit demo templates: Too complex for our needs
- Custom setup from scratch: More work, less standardization

## Component Architecture Approach

**Decision**: Implement strict Atomic Design hierarchy

**Rationale**:
- Matches project constitution requirements
- Provides clear separation of concerns
- Enables UI library swapping in the future
- Supports maintainability and scalability

**Alternatives considered**:
- Monolithic components: Violates encapsulation principle
- Less structured approach: Would make future refactoring difficult

## Google Maps Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Use @googlemaps/js-api-loader with Svelte wrapper component

**Rationale**:
- Official Google Maps library with TypeScript support
- Lazy loading capabilities for performance
- Clean integration with Svelte's reactive system
- Avoids heavy wrapper libraries

**Alternatives considered**:
- Third-party Svelte Google Maps components: Added complexity and dependencies
- Direct script injection: Less maintainable and type-safe

## Data Validation Approach

**Decision**: Use arktype for schema validation

**Rationale**:
- Required by project constitution
- TypeScript-first approach with excellent type inference
- Runtime validation with compile-time types
- Clean API and good performance

**Alternatives considered**:
- Zod: More popular but not mandated by constitution
- Yup: JavaScript-first, less TypeScript integration

## Content Management Strategy

**Decision**: Use content-collections for static content

**Rationale**:
- Required by project constitution
- Type-safe content loading from Markdown files
- Integrates well with SvelteKit
- Supports i18n via directory structure

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct file reading: Less type-safe and more error-prone
- CMS integration: Overkill for static content

## Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Implement mobile-first PWA with service worker

**Rationale**:
- Required by project constitution
- Provides offline capabilities
- Improves perceived performance
- Better user experience on mobile devices

**Alternatives considered**:
- Standard SPA: Would not meet PWA requirements
- Native app: Overkill for our web-based approach
